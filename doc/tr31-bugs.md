TR31 Security Bugs (UCD Versions 1-14)
======================================

U+FF00..U+FFEF not as ID
---------------------------

Most of the U+FF00..U+FFEF Full and Halfwidth letters have incorrectly
`ID_Start` resp.  `ID_Continue` properties. XID ditto.
They should not, because they are confusable with the normal
characters in the base planes.  E.g. LATIN A-Z are indistuingishable
from Ａ..Ｚ, LATIN a-z from ａ..ｚ, likewise for the Katakana ｦ..ｯ and
ｱ..ﾝ, and the Hangul ﾠ..ﾾ, ￂ..ￇ, ￊ..ￏ, ￒ..ￗ ￚ..ￜ halfwidth letters.

This is esp. for TR39 a security risk. TR39 provides Identifier Type
properties to exclude insecure identifiers, but I cannot find any
other type property to set these U+FF21..U+FFDC IDs to, than
`Not_XID`. Thus the `ID_Start`/`ID_Continue` property should be
deleted for all of them. If they are not identifiable, they should not
be marked as such.

Medial letters in `ID_Start`, not `ID_Continue`
-------------------------------------------------

DerivedCoreProperties lists all of the Arabic and Thai MEDIAL letters,
which are part of identifiers in `ID_Start`, not in `ID Continue`. Only
the Combining marks are in `ID_Continue`.  Thus all unicode-aware
parsers accept such MEDIAL letters incorrectly in the start
position. They should only be allowed in the `ID_Continue` position,
and parsers should disallow them in the end positions for identifiers.

All the other medial letters (Myanmar, Canadian Aboriginal, Ahom,
Dives Akuru) are not part of Recommended Scripts, so they do not
affect TR39 security. But since almost nobody but Java, cperl and Rust
honor TR39 it's still affecting most parsers.

Other medial exceptions are noted in TR31 at 2.4 Specific Character
Adjustments, but the tables DerivedCoreProperties and TR39 Identifier
tables and thus all user parsers are wrong.
<https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Specific_Character_Adjustments>

For the proposed C++26/C26 standard no such medial characters are
included.

Confusable Technical IdTypes
----------------------------

DerivedCoreProperties.txt lists the three ǃ U+1C3 "LATIN LETTER ALVEOLAR CLICK"
ǀ U+1C0 "LATIN LETTER DENTAL CLICK" and ǁ U+1C1 "LATIN LETTER LATERAL CLICK"
as `ID_Start`. But they should not be included in ID at all, as they are
confusable with common operators.

TR39 IdentifierTypes.txt lists the three ǃ U+1C3 "LATIN LETTER
ALVEOLAR CLICK" ǀ U+1C0 "LATIN LETTER DENTAL CLICK" and ǁ U+1C1 "LATIN
LETTER LATERAL CLICK" as Technical. So for normal IdentifierStatus
Allowed these would be excluded.  But C++26 whishes to add Technical
also. Add at least an Exclusion, if not the Non_XID property for XID
stability concerns. But security bugs should trump stability
guarantees.

for an exploit.

Arabic Presentation Forms-A: U+FB50–U+FDFF and Forms-B: U+FE70–U+FEFF not as ID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forms-A contains a list of Arabic presentation forms encoded as
characters primarily for compatibility reasons.  Forms-B are for
compatibility with preexisting standards and legacy implementations
that use these forms as character. Instead of these, letters from the
Arabic block (U+0600..U+06FF) should be used for identifiers.  See
<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch09.pdf#G37489> and
<https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr53/>. The TR39 idtype of these
should be changed to Obsolete.
