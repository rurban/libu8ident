# C11

The unicode security guidelines for identifiers specify some rules
for identifiers to stay identifiable. Most language and tool
implementors ignored them when they added unicode support to their language.

Only extremely few resisted, or did implement it. Java, cperl and rust
properly implemented it.  zig and J refused.  gcc came up with in version
10, but the feature request started in 2015. clang has it since 3.3,
msvc focuses on insecure UTF-16 instead.

# The insecure C Standard C11

The C11 standard started allowing a certain range of (mostly insecure) AltId
codepoints, and did not define a XID profile, nor any TR39 security restrictions.
Thus this is an insecure Unrestricted profile 6.
In libu8ident this is `U8ID_PROFILE_C11_6`, defined by `-DU8ID_PROFILE_C11STD`
See `unic11.h` and [N2731](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2731.pdf)
Annex D (p. 425)

The C11 standard ignores secure IdentifierTypes, mixed scripts violations and more.
This allows easy Arabic right-to-left overrides, Greek + Cyrillic confusables, and
does not mandate a normalization of identifiers, leading to confusables
even with Latin-only C identifiers.

See <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1518.htm>
summarizing the
[tr31#Alternative_Identifier_Syntax](http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Alternative_Identifier_Syntax)
\[AltId\] in where anything is allowed but: white space, "syntax" characters,
private use characters, surrogates, control characters, and
non-characters.

They hereby violated their own recommendations of
<http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/sc22/WG20/docs/n970-tr10176-2002.pdf> to
only allow Allowed Identifiers, which is to only allow the following
properties:

* L& The symbol "L&" indicates characters of type Lu, Ll, or Lt (see below).
* Lu Letter, Uppercase
* Ll Letter, Lowercase
* Lt Letter, Titlecase
* Lm Letter, Modifier
* Lo Letter, Other
* Mn Mark, Non-Spacing
* Mc Mark, Spacing Combining
* Nd Number, Decimal Digit
* Nl Number, Letter
* Pc Punctuation, Connector

referring to the table TR10176-4. In practice you would also disallow
Excluded and Limited Use scripts, only allow Allowed IdentifierStatus XID's,
and check for mixed-script violations.

The C++ Working Group detected the XID problem in
[n2836](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2836.pdf) for
C++23, but found that implementing TR39 would be too hard. "This proposal
does not address some potential security concerns—so called homoglyph
attacks—where letters that appear the same may be treated as
distinct. Methods of defense against such attacks are complex and
evolving, and requiring mitigation strategies would impose substantial
implementation burden." [p194R7](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1949r7.html)

Mixed script detection such as done here is certainly not as hard as
TR31 mitigation and esp. NFC normalization. It is also not evolving, TR39 is
standardized since Unicode 6, with its earliest revisions in [2006](https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/revision-02/).

# The SAFEC26 Extension

I provide a fixed version of the C++ and C standard for secure unicode
identifers with a special profile, called SAFEC26.  This is an
extended Moderate Profile, plus allowing **Greek** scripts with Latin,
plus only allowing a special SAFEC26 TR31 charset. You realistically only
get something into the C standard if you get it into C++ first.

The secure extension disallows the Restricted and Limited_Use scripts
and identifiers, disallows arbitrary right-to-left and left-to-right
overrides within identifiers (i.e. no Latin + Arabic mixes), and
disallows all the insecure mixed scripts combinations. But you can
still write and compile unreadable Asian or Indian C code, or even
Arabic (right-to-left), as long as you don't mix it with Latin
(left-to-right).

# Compilers

The insecure C11 unicode identifiers were added to gcc, clang and
chibicc. C99 already allowed Extended C99 Identifiers with \u and \U escape
sequences.
msvc claims to support them, but does not so yet, it rather focuses on insecure
UTF-16 identifiers.
[pcc](http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/ftp/pub/pcc-docs/pcc-utf8-ver3.pdf) was
worked on also.  Don't know about other C compilers, most likely they
are still secure.

* gcc added these with version 10. See [PR
  67224](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67224) but it
  generated (unrestricted) UTF-8 encoded ASM output before. So you can
  link against earlier GCC object files.

* clang started secure Extended C99 Identifier support (`\uxxxx`) plus insecure
  C11 Unicode Identifiers with version 3.3.
  [ReleaseNotes](https://releases.llvm.org/3.3/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html),
  [godbolt clang 3.3](https://godbolt.org/z/1dzMxPhvc)

* MSVC has [Unicode support in the compiler and linker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/unicode-support-in-the-compiler-and-linker?view=msvc-140)
  for identifiers, included filenames (apparently unsanitized, so RTL
  attacks are possible. Plus for macros, string and character
  literals. Since at least Visual Studio 2015. But there's a MSVC
  [Feature Request](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/feature-request-allow-unicode-characters-in-identi/821782)
  to add insecure UTF-8 identifiers to MSVC. Apparently it doesn't
  support them now. [godbolt msvc 19](https://godbolt.org/z/xrnPnGPff)

* icc since version 19. [godbolt icc 18](https://godbolt.org/z/8fhsf5xhT)

* chibicc also took the C11 standard ranges:
  [unicode.c](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commits/main/unicode.c).
  My [Unicode security improvements over
  C11](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/issues/32) request is open.

* pcc acknowledges that the original C11 set _"is not restrictive
  enough to ensure readable code"_.
  <http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/ftp/pub/pcc-docs/pcc-utf8-ver3.pdf>,
  but does nothing much against it. The preprocessor translates UTF-8
  chars to escaped `\Uxxxxxxxxx` strings though, to make them even
  more unreadable, but at least allows for easier tool checks.

# Linters

* clang-tidy can check with readability-identifier-naming for
  identifiers naming style mismatch (cases), but does not warn on any
  unicode security guideline violations. It could be easily added though.

* This u8idlint started with unicode identifiers checks.

* <https://github.com/NebulousLabs/glyphcheck> found no malicious homoglyphs
  in publicly available Go source files yet.

I know of no other linters or security checkers doing unicode
identifiers checks, even when the C11 standard referred to linters to
do such checks.  A binutils linter is also needed to check compiled
libraries for insecure identifiers.  See my binutils-gdb repo on
github for a patched readelf to perform checks on unicode symbols.

# Tools

I provide with a libu8ident a fixed version of the C++/C standard for
a secure unicode identifers profile, called
**`U8ID_PROFILE_C26_4`**, defined by `-DU8ID_PROFILE_SAFEC26`. This is
an extended Moderate Profile (4), plus allowing Greek with Latin, plus
only allowing Allowed IdentifierTypes. It also demands NFC normalization.
See `unic11.h`, `unic26.h` and `mkc26.c`.

# Others

C++, perl5, perl6 (now raku), ruby, python, php, swift, julia, D, nim, crystal
... all added insecure unicode identifiers in the last years. php just by accident,
not on purpose.

**zig** refused to add unicode identifiers in the latest two feature requests.
Not so much because of its insecurity, more of hazzles with the yearly changing
Unicode standard. Valid source code could suddenly become invalid.
**J** also stayed with ASCII only.

**Clojure** is also safe recommending only ASCII identifiers,
[Symbols](https://clojure.org/reference/reader#_symbols), but you can intern
abritrary strings at will. Same as **Common Lisp** and all lisps in general.
There are no identifier/symbol security considerations in place at all, similar
to filesystems.

**cperl** (an improved perl5) is very secure. It uses the security
profile 4, does NFC normalization internally, and allows adding
Limited_Use scripts, and special encodings for identifiers.

**rust** is pretty secure.
Support was discussed in [RFC 2457](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55467),
[GH 28979](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28979) and
[GH 2253](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/2253)
and is described as [TR31 compatible](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/identifiers.html).
Don't know if they decided on NFC or NFKC normalization.
People are still pushing for _more inclusive_ (i.e. insecure) unicode identifiers.

**C#** and **F#** follow TR31 and do NFC normalization, but do not check for mixed
scripts nor Excluded scripts. [Identifiers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199552)

**python** [PIP 3131](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131/) at least
does normalization (NFKC, an odd joice), but does not check for mixed
scripts nor Excluded scripts. They did read TR39, but didn't understand
nor follow it.

**Java**
[identifiers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.8)
mentions only TR31, but no mixed scripts profile nor Excluded scripts
checks. Comparison/lookup only ignores ignorables, but does no normalization.

**perl** checks same as python for `XID_Start`/`XID_Continue` properties,
which is at least a bit better than C11. It does not check for mixed
scripts nor Excluded scripts, nor does it identifier normalization.
But perl5.16 started even adding support for binary names with embedded
`\0` in 2012. Which is highly insecure, because names are mapped to
filenames and paths when including modules, and the filesystem just
stops searching at the `\0`. This way you can trivially hide shellcode
in user-identifiers.
Earlier perls allowed single source encoding, like Cyrillic, which was
very secure, but abandonded thata few years ago. cperl kept that. ALGOL 68
also allowed encodings (a representation language), but even for its keywords.

**C++** has the same insecure unicode identifiers as C.

**javascript** in
[ES5](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers) used Lu,
Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo or Nl for their `ID_Start`, and adds Mn, Mc, Nd and Pc
to their `ID_Cont`. (i.e. TR31 profile 5), but no mixed scripts nor
Excluded scripts, No identifier normalization. Same as DefId as they
discussed early in C11, but abandoned for the insecure AltId
variant. [ES6](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6)
then went more insecure by allowing all ID\_Start and ID\_Cont
characters.

**Julia** [Allowed Variable
Names](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables/#man-allowed-variable-names)
went with TR31 and profile 5, but has some special subset. No mixed scripts nor
Excluded scripts, but NFC normalization and some confusable handling.

**nim** [Identifiers &
Keywords](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#lexical-analysis-identifiers-amp-keywords)
allows everything as identifier, every unicode character above 127 is
a letter, not-normalized. So they have unidentifiable identifers, and
should rather use a new name for that. Maybe "name" or "symbol"
instead of identifier.

**crystal** [Symbol](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.2/syntax_and_semantics/literals/symbol.html)
allows similarilty binary chunk as nim, everything above 159 is a letter for them.
**Lua** and **luajit** also don't care much about unicode identifiers being identifiable.

**D** also supports all raw unicode characters as identifiers.
<http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi?DanielKeep/TextInD>

**Factor** ditto.

**Go** is UTF-8 and defines its
[identifers](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Identifiers) as letters, so
TR31 ID. It does not check for mixed scripts nor Excluded scripts, nor
does normalization. An exported name must begin with Lu (Uppercase Letter).

**Haskell** identifiers must start with Ll (Lowercase Letter), but no further
restrictions or normalization support AFAIK.

**php** does not support unicode identifiers nor UTF-8 encodings, but
does accidently so, by allowing everything in
`[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*`, which leads the same
insecurities as with nim and crystal, treating everything above 127 as letter.

**Ada 95** supports raw unicode identifiers, but you need to specify
its encoding. You can bet its entirely insecure.

Modern **Forth** as glorified stack assembler allows everything
unidentifiable.  Older FORTH was safe though.

**Rosetta Code** has a general overview of unicode identifiers in all
programming languages, but without its special insecurities and
caveats: <https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Unicode_variable_names>

Generally they were all very fast to add insecure unicode names
(ignoring the official security guidelines), and also provided a slow
SipHash security theatre for their hash tables instead of proper hash
table security.
