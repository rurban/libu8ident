libu8ident 0.3 - 2022-12-03

Fixed a bug with excluded scripts which are only now addable.
Change is_greek_latin_confus violations with TR39_4 to return ERR_CONFUS,
not ERR_SCRIPTS (GH #12).
Add more combining marks checks (GH #7): TR39#5.5 "Forbid sequences of base character
+ nonspacing mark that look the same as or confusingly similar to the base character
alone". Also forbid non-spacing marks with base chars already including the
non-spacing mark, like Ä with DIAERESIS.
Update to Unicode version 15.0.0:
  - 11 new mark ranges.
  - 2 new Excluded scripts: Kawi, Nag Mundari.
  - The zero width joiner (ZWJ) and zero width non-joiner (ZWNJ) changed to IdStatus
    Restricted.
  - More id and xid chars

libu8ident 0.2 - 2022-02-12:

Bump SOLIB MAJOR to 1
The C++23 deadline is gone, rename all c23 to c26. Esp. command-line
and configure options.
Fixed TR39 to exclude confusable Technical, and to skip a lot of
not Allowed ID_Start ranges.

libu8ident 0.1 - 2022-01-24:

First release, with the library, u8idlint and lots of C23 support:
the optimized unic23.h, and the 2 technical papers for C23++ and C23
to use TR39.
