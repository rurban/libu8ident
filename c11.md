The unicode securiyty guidelines for identifiers specify some rules
for identifiers to stay identifiable. Most language and tool
implementors ignored them, when they added unicode support to their language.

Only extremely few resisted, or did implement it. Java, cperl and rust
properly implemented it.  zig refused.  gcc came up with in version
10, but the feature request started in 2015. clang has it since 3.3,
msvc focuses on insecure UTF-16 instead.

# The insecure C Standard C11

The C11 standard started allowing a certain range of (mostly insecure) AltId
codepoints, and did not define combinations of mixed scripts, nor a
security profile.  Thus this is an insecure Unrestricted profile 6, also ignoring
the UCD IdentifierStatus. In libu8ident this is `U8ID_PROFILE_C11_6`, defined by
`-DU8ID_PROFILE_C11STD`
See `unic11.h` and http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2731.pdf
Annex D (p. 425)

The C11 standard ignores mixed scripts violation, this allows easy
Arabic right-to-left overrides, Greek + Cyrillic confusables, and does
not mandate a normalization of identifiers, leading to confusables
even with Latin-only C identifiers.

See http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1518.htm
summarizing the
http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Alternative_Identifier_Syntax [AltId] 
in where anything is allowed but: white space, "syntax" characters,
private use characters, surrogates, control characters, and
non-characters.

They hereby violated their own recommendations of http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/sc22/WG20/docs/n970-tr10176-2002.pdf to only allow Allowed Identifiers, which is to only allow the following properties:

    L& The symbol "L&" indicates characters of type Lu, Ll, or Lt (see below).
    Lu Letter, Uppercase
    Ll Letter, Lowercase
    Lt Letter, Titlecase
    Lm Letter, Modifier
    Lo Letter, Other
    Mn Mark, Non-Spacing
    Mc Mark, Spacing Combining
    Nd Number, Decimal Digit
    Nl Number, Letter
    Pc Punctuation, Connector

referring to the table TR10176-4.

# The safeC11 Extension

I provide a fixed version of the C standard for secure unicode
identifers with a special profile, called SAFEC11.  This is an
extended Moderate Profile, plus allowing **Greek** scripts with Latin,
plus only allowing Allowed [**IdentifierStatus**](https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest/IdentifierStatus.txt) codepoints. It also demands the parser (i.e. the lexer) to check
for the extended safe unicode ranges already (for performance reasons),
and demands internal normalization to NFC.

The secure extension disallows the Restricted and Limited_Use scripts
and identifiers, disallows arbitrary rtl and ltr overrides within
identifiers (i.e. no Latin + Arabic mixes), and disallows all the
insecure mixed scripts combinations. But you can still write and
compile unreadable Asian or Indian C code, or even Arabic
(right-to-left), as long as you don't mix it with Latin
(left-to-right).

# Compilers

These insecure C11 unicode identifiers were added to gcc, clang and
chibicc. C99 already allowed Extended C99 Identifiers with \u and \U escape
sequences.
msvc claims to support them, but does not so yet.
[pcc](http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/ftp/pub/pcc-docs/pcc-utf8-ver3.pdf) was
worked on also.  Don't know about other C compilers, most likely they
are still secure.

* gcc added these with version 10. See [PR 67224](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67224)
  but it generated (unrestricted) UTF-8 encoded ASM output before. So you can link against
  earlier GCC object files.

* clang started secure Extended C99 Identifier support (`\uxxxx`) plus insecure
  C11 Unicode Identifiers with version 3.3.
  [ReleaseNotes](https://releases.llvm.org/3.3/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html),
  [godbolt clang 3.3](https://godbolt.org/z/1dzMxPhvc)

* MSVC has [Unicode support in the compiler and linker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/unicode-support-in-the-compiler-and-linker?view=msvc-140)
  for identifiers, included filenames (apparently unsanitized, so RTL
  attacks are possible. Plus for macros, string and character
  literals. Since at least Visual Studio 2015. But there's a MSVC
  [Feature Request](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/feature-request-allow-unicode-characters-in-identi/821782)
  to add insecure UTF-8 identifiers to MSVC. Apparently it doesn't
  support them now. [godbolt msvc 19](https://godbolt.org/z/xrnPnGPff)

* icc since version 19. [godbolt icc 18](https://godbolt.org/z/8fhsf5xhT)

* chibicc also took the C11 standard ranges: [unicode.c](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commits/main/unicode.c).
  My [Unicode security improvements over C11](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/issues/32) request is open.

* pcc acknowledges that the original C11 set _"is not restrictive enough to ensure readable code"_. http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/ftp/pub/pcc-docs/pcc-utf8-ver3.pdf, but does nothing much against it. The preprocessor translates UTF-8 chars to escaped `\Uxxxxxxxxx` strings though, to make them even more unreadable, but at least allows for easier tool checks.


# Linters

* clang-tidy can check with readability-identifier-naming for
  identifiers naming style mismatch (cases), but does not warn on any
  unicode security guideline violations.
  
I know of no linters or security checkers doing unicode identifiers checks,
even when the C11 standard referred to linters to do such checks.

# Tools

I provide with a libu8ident a fixed version of the C standard for
a special secure unicode identifers profile, called
**`U8ID_PROFILE_C11_4`**, defined by `-DU8ID_PROFILE_SAFEC11`. This is
an extended Moderate Profile (4), plus allowing Greek with Latin, plus
only allowing Allowed IdentifierStatus. It also demands NFC normalization.
See `unic11.h` and `test-c11.c`.

# Others

C++, perl5, perl6 (now raku), ruby, python, php, swift, julia all
added insecure unicode identifiers in the last years.

python at least does NFKC normalization, but does not check for mixed
scripts nor Excluded scripts.

perl checks same as python for `XID_Start`/`XID_Continue` properties,
which is at least a bit better than C11. It does not check for mixed
scripts nor Excluded scripts, nor does it identifier normalization.
But perl5 started even adding support for binary names with embedded
`\0` in 2012. Which is highly insecure, because names are mapped to
filenames and paths when including modules, and the filesystem just
stops searching at the `\0`. This way you can trivially hide shellcode
in user-identifiers.

No idea about the others, like lua, crystal, nim, haskell, ... They were
all very fast to provide a SipHash security theatre for their hash tables instead
of proper hash table security, so my expectations are low.

**C++** has the same insecure unicode identifiers as C.

**javascript** in [ES5](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers)
used Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo or Nl for their `ID_Start`, and adds Mn, Mc, Nd and Pc
to their `ID_Cont`. Thus no mixed scripts nor Excluded scripts, nor
identifier normalization. [ES6](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6)
went more insecure by allowing all ID\_Start and ID\_Cont characters.

**zig** refused to add unicode identifiers in the latest two feature requests.
Not so much because of its insecurity, more of hazzles with the yearly changing
Unicode standard. Valid source code could suddenly become invalid.

**rust** support was discussed in [RFC 2457](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55467),
[GH 28979](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28979) and 
[GH 2253](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/2253)
and is described as [TR31 compatible](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/identifiers.html).
Don't know if they decided on NFC or NFKC normalization.
People are still pushing for _more inclusive_ (i.e. insecure) unicode identifiers.
